# Customizable Makefile template.
#
# This Makefile should work for projects using the Google style guide out of
# the box. Source files should be called some/dir/foo.cpp. To create a binary
# some/other/dir/mybin, simply create a source file named
# some/other/dir/mybin_main.cpp. `make' will build all such binaries by default.

# FULL_SOURCES should include all source files.
FULL_SOURCES := ${shell find . -name "*.cpp" | sed "s|^\./||"}
# FULL_HEADERS should include all header files.
FULL_HEADERS := ${shell find . -name "*.h" | sed "s|^\./||"}

# MAIN_SOURCES should be the subset of FULL_SOURCES that have main functions.
MAIN_SOURCES := ${filter %_main.cpp,${FULL_SOURCES}}

# TARGETS should include all binaries you want to generate.
TARGETS := ${patsubst %_main.cpp,%,${MAIN_SOURCES}}

# DEFAULT_BUILD_TARGETS should specify which targets to build if make is run
# with no arguments.
DEFAULT_BUILD_TARGETS := joosc test

# CXX is the C++ compiler.
CXX := /usr/local/clang-3.4/bin/clang++
# CXXFLAGS are the flags passed to the C++ compiler.
CXXFLAGS := -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -MMD -MP -g -pedantic -I third_party/stdlib/ -I ./ -include std.h
# LDFLAGS are the flags passed to the C++ linker.
LDFLAGS := -lpthread

# If one of the sanitizers are enabled, then append the appropriate thing to
# CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS. Note that we do this before genering BUILD_CACHE_KEY,
# so we don't re-use values across different kinds of builds.

# Note how we're using the TO_BUILD_DIR macro; this is important, as the deps
# need to be inside the build directory.  Don't forget to comment out the
